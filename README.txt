Hi, welcome to my Movies Trailer website

Here are the instruction to install this website:

Download files from this Github repository: https://github.com/amharF/UdacityProjects

Once downloaded you will find three files:

1) media.py

This module defines the classes for movies 

2) entertainment_center.py

This module defines the instances of the movies with their attributes
Then the movies are stored in an array

The application is run from this file (use F5)

3) fresh_tomatoes.py

This module takes all movies in the array and creates a HTML page with CSS/Javascript markup which allow you to view all movies in a gallery and play their trailers

Enjoy!
